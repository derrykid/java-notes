Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and name of fields.

Record class has the following:

- private final field for each data
- getter for each field
- public constructor with corresponding argument for each field
- methods of `equal`, `hashCode`, `toString` generated


Basic use:
```java
public record Person (String name, String address) {}
```

Hence, you can create a Person object:
```java
Person person = new Person("John", "Oak road");
```

## Getters
It's generated by compiler:

**Note that it does not start with 'get'** 

```java
String name = person.name();
String address = person.address();
```

## Static variables and methods

We can include static variables and methods 

```java
public record Person(String name, String address) {
    public static String DEFAULT_ADDRESS = "Oak road";

    public static Person unnamed(String address) {
        return new Person("Unname", address);
    }
}
```
